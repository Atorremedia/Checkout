## Stack

###ReactJS
This Javascript library was used in order to make a component-based project, so it is modularized and scalable. Modularization helps specially in code maintenance, wich is key to any coding project.

####Vite
Vite was used to set the React project and boundle it. The use of Vite has been spreading lately due to its efficiency and ease of use.

####React Forms Hook
This React Library is used as a systematic way to handle this form. It allows to implement even more control on the form if it is needed at any time.

####Tailwind
For a simple design as the proposed for this exercise, in combination with React, Tailwind offered a simple way to set styles. Variables are used to help keeping the code clean and easy to mantain:

```shell
    const inputContainerStyle = 'input-container relative flex flex-col justify-items-center items-start mt-5 '
    const labelStyle = 'label mt-[9px] text-sm leading-[14px] font-medium';
    const inputStyle = 'input w-full h-10 text-lg mt-[8px] p-3 border border-solid border-[1.5px] border-[#A7BAC5] placeholder-[#A7BAC5] placeholder-font-300 rounded-lg';
    const validationStyle = 'validation-msg absolute top-[72px] text-xs font-semibold ml-2 text-red-400'
```

```shell
            <div className={`${inputContainerStyle} mt-[24px]`}>
```

## Roadmap and visuals

The apparence of the project is simple and readable. It has a default view, with the form the user needs to fill. It has, however two information screens that can be shown over it: the featured cards pannel and the CVV info pannel:

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-around">
    <div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; justify-content:center; align-items:center">
        <img src="./images/checkout_screenshot1.png" alt="default view" width="200" style="margin:10px"/>
        <p>Default view</p>
    </div>
    <div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; justify-content:center; align-items:center">
        <img src="./images/checkout_screenshot2.png" alt="featured credit cards" width="200"/>
        <p>Featured credit cards</p>
    </div>
    <div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; justify-content:center; align-items:center">
        <img src="./images/checkout_screenshot3.png" alt="cvv security code" width="200"/>
        <p>CVV security code</p>
    </div>
</div>
